# Devote

Devote was created by Ibrahim Chowdhury, Francesco Collotto, Sarah Dousse, Inigo Meshoulam, and Christopher Webb. The application was built using React, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

# What is Devote?
Devote is a money management tool allowing users to round-up day-to-day transactions so that they can start saving money without feeling the pinch. Users can create saving "pots". These can be for personal savings, investments or charities registered on the Devote system.

# Getting Started with Devote

Run the Rails server in the backend directory (also available on GitHub) first before running in the project's frontend directory:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
